In search problems, we can employ a strategy known as branch and bound. This strategy belongs to uninformed search, meaning the only information available about the problem is its initial state and its goal state. With this strategy, we aim to find the optimal solution more efficiently by attempting to reduce the search space.
To carry out the implementation of this strategy in the code, an open list will be used to order the partial paths based on the accumulated cost of each.

Besides employing branch and bound, a heuristic will be used to guide the search, reduce the search space, enhance execution time, and optimize the solution.

For this project, the problem of Romania will be employed to apply the implementation of branch and bound. This is a famous problem in artificial intelligence and heuristic search involving finding the shortest route between cities on a map of Romanian roads.
